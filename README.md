# MyPortFolio

Recently, I learnt about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, nodeJS, reactJS and VanillaJs. I have made my Potfolio using all the required tools.

## What I have added in the Portfolio.

Home Page - Where I added 'About Me' , 'Technologies' I knew, 'Projects' I have done and 'Blogs' which I wrote.
Projects - There is a detailed listing of Projects which I made and you have Live access as well as code access for each project.
Blogs - There is detailed listing of Blogs under this section.

Apart from these, there is 'About' and 'Technology' buttons in nav bar for direct access.
